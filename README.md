nes-demos
=========

This is a collection of various NES demos that I've written, mainly for
the hell of it.

You can build the demos with ``make``. The NES ROMs will be placed in the
``bin`` directory.

Unfortunately, I have not tested these on a real NES just yet. But I
want to share these as I write them.
