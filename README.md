nes-demos
=========

This is a collection of various NES demos that I've written, mainly for
the hell of it.

In order to build the demos, you'll need to have the binaries from
[cc65](http://github.com/cc65/cc65) in your path. Then, you can
build these demos with ``make``. The NES ROMs will be placed in the
bin directory.

These demos have been tested and found to be working as expected on
a real NES.
